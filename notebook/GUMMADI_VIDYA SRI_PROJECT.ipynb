) by mistake . ,the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) . ,hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # ,1521 ) . ,two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . ,orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . ,yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . ,i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! ,the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . ,thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . ,the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . ,any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . ,the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . ,there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . ,while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . ,the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . ,i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . ,the script for this film is completely pathetic . ,the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . ,the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . ,here is an example of the wonderful dialog . ,the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . ,the line is \\\" my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . \\\" ,this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . ,now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . ,one comment from an actress is \\\" not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . \\\" ,i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . ,now lets talk about the great special effects for this film . ,this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . ,the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence . ,a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . ,are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? ,the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . ,in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . ,very impressive trick ! ,the one ( half ? ) ,plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . ,the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . ,however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . ,in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . ,i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . ,oh well , win some , lose some . ,\",\n          \"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled \\\" dragnet \\\" reruns off the air . ,sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . ,even though \\\" dragnet \\\" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous \\\" blue boy \\\" episode of \\\" dragnet . \\\" ,for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . ,as what would happen if sgt . ,joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . ,in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . ,the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters . ,he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . ,the \\\" produced and directed by jack webb \\\" card pretty much goes without saying . ,this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . ,i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . ,gives us more -- much more . ,webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . ,the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will \\\" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . \\\" , ( whether the \\\" lace panties \\\" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) ,this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell . ,for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his . ,i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . . , \\\" now you listen to me , youngster . ,someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . . ,i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . \\\" ,i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . , ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . ,he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . ,webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , \\\" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? \\\" ,bogart he ain't . ,the other d . i . ,gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , \\\" he's a damn good d . i . , . . . ,i guess i'm just a little jealous . \\\" ,join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . , \\\" you expect me to talk to you . . . ,in _here_ ? ! \\\" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . ,the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . ,a little girl spots him in the store and demands , \\\" what are you doing in here . . . you're a man , aren't you ? \\\" ,he doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , \\\" what an odd species of human -- so small . ,must be one of those children everyone's been talking about . \\\" ,this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for . ,the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . ,after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , \\\" was that flea you killed a male or female ? \\\" ,owens replies , \\\" a male , sir . \\\" ,webb yells to the platoon , \\\" this ain't the one ! \\\" ,that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . ,but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . ,webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . ,someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did . ,it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . ,there's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . ,webb bursts in the room and shouts , \\\" what did i tell you about laughing ? ! \\\" ,to which the private replies , \\\" sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! \\\" ,and let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie . ,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life . ,getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development . ,gavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche . ,we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity . ,birdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout . ,the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life . ,despite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer . ,for a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance . ,gavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat . ,after minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life . ,helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father . ,gavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character . ,peter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer . ,the scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat . ,gavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie . ,her life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce . ,gavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . ,getting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . ,first , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . ,second , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . ,overall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . ,director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery . ,\",\n          \"carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california . ,there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore , who is a city boy . ,when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled . ,dan gauthier , gugino's boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino . ,gugino isn't ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore . ,she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end . ,forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son-in-law is the film to see this summer . ,son-in-law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez . ,when son-in-law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then . ,this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it . ,nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen . ,although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch . ,the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around . ,the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old . ,there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven't seen before . ,still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still . ,this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price . ,the cast for this film does an excellent job . ,pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film . ,he is great , and knows how to entertain the audience . ,pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious . ,this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role . ,carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl . ,she makes her character believable , on some levels , yet interesting at the same time . ,the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job . ,the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen . ,patrick renna , who played gugino's little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him . ,tiffani-amber thiessen ( a killer among friends , \\\" saved by the bell \\\" ) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen . ,she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television . ,she wasn't given overly much to do in the film , but what she had , she does a good job with . ,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

a star for guts  anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts  i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show  the script was the worst part  they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh  they had lots of  great  sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door  turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show  the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left  buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies  tell them the show is great and smile a lot        one of the top few films of this or any year  a must see film       excellent show  look for it      average movie  kind of enjoyable     poor show  dont waste your money    one of the worst films of this or any year  totally unbearable  review written on  september    opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employers  \",\n          \"five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there  is this starting to sound familiar   by mistake  the girls accidentlly open the box  big surprise  huh   and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one  betcha didnt see that one coming    hard to die  i found out while watching the film  is a sequel to sorority house massacre   nightie nightmare  r  a  m  r      two of the actresses from sorority house massacre  are in this film  robyn harris and melissa moore  but they play different characters here  orville ketchum is also back as  get ready for this  orville ketchum  yes  the same character from number two   yes  he is also built like a tank in this film too  im telling you  a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldnt harm him at all  the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act  well they seemed to have lost that ability  thankfully  for my sanity  i also saw the film warlock  which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film  the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks  any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line  the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out  analyzed  and discarded before it happens  there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot  while we are on the subject of the story  the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress  the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the managers office  im sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary  ridiculous  and hurts the story more  if that is still possible   the script for this film is completely pathetic  the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible  the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along  here is an example of the wonderful dialog  the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a  really  big gun  the line is  my dad used to be a marine  i bet i can work it   this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy  now  we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan       has been presented  one comment from an actress is  not a lot of strategy involved  but i like it   im afraid folks that this is about as good as they get  now lets talk about the great special effects for this film  this obviously wasnt a big concern of the film makers  the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewers intelligence  a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the th movie  are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get  the continuity department was obviously asleep  along with the viewers  when watching this film  in one shot  actress has cloths on  camera angle changes  actress seems to have lost clothing  very impressive trick  the one  half   plus that this film has going for it  is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious  the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny  and so the viewer can get some enjoyment       from the film  however  this doesnt make it worth the rental fee of over a penny  in the acting department  the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down  i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic  but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least  oh well  win some  lose some  \",\n          \"my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled  dragnet  reruns off the air  sure  id seen them all at least once  but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  even though  dragnet  is out of circulation at the moment  we webb antifans still have the d  i   a s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous  blue boy  episode of  dragnet   for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness  think of the d  i  as what would happen if sgt  joe friday ever enlisted  because he plays exactly the same character here  a nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded  melodramatic speeches on any topic  in this election year  im more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters  he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  the  produced and directed by jack webb  card pretty much goes without saying  this is his movie all the way  and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason  i was wondering if there would even be a plot  i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants  but the d  i  gives us more  much more  webbs mission is to make a man out of private owens  the local screwup  the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or  the captain will  personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself     whether the  lace panties  part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered   this  of course  gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell  for those of you who havent been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching  heres a reprint of a typical monologue of his  i cant duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper  but the words should at least partially convey what im talking about      now you listen to me  youngster  someday youll wake up fighting on a beach and youll pray to god somebody doesnt get killed because of your foolishness    ive got a headline for you  every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours  youre gonna turn around and ill be standing right there   i couldnt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i    nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame   but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines  like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard days work by going to the local bar  where he orders a tomato juice   he meets a woman who  coincidentally  also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival  another marine d  i  webb marches over to the table  gets up in her face and says   just what kind of a dame do you think you are   bogart he aint  the other d  i  gets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl   hes a damn good d  i      i guess im just a little jealous   join the club  were all jealous of jack webbs way with women  which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene  as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment  a lingerie store  and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display    you expect me to talk to you    in here    he exclaims  no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras  the woman goes off to help a customer  leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen  a little girl spots him in the store and demands   what are you doing in here    youre a man  arent you   he doesnt reply  but you know hes thinking in his head   what an odd species of human  so small  must be one of those children everyones been talking about   this poor girl  scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb  would later swear off the male gender entirely  just one of the many lesbian conversions hes responsible for  the movie doesnt focus too closely on webbs romance  it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie  where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills  after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea  webb asks owens   was that flea you killed a male or female   owens replies   a male  sir   webb yells to the platoon   this aint the one   that such a scene  along with the rest of the movie  was intended to be taken seriously defies comment  but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d  i   but for iwo jima  guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century  webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie  with the exception of owens  were played by actual marines  someone wanting to parody this movie couldnt do a more comical job than webb did  it makes it all the more ironic  like raeeyain on your wedding day  that the man had no sense of humor himself  theres a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter  webb bursts in the room and shouts   what did i tell you about laughing    to which the private replies   sir  only nineyearold girls laugh  sir   and let me tell you  i was as happy as a nineyear old girl while watching this movie  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity  the film was directed by randal kleiser  who brought us such bubblegum classics as grease and the blue lagoon  but thanks to kleisers surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script  getting it right is a pleasantly quiet  moving  and memorable filmone geared strictly toward a sophisticated  adult audience  getting it right stars jesse birdsall  emily lloyds boyfriend in wish you were here  as gavin  a painfully shy yearold hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and whogaspis still a virgin  gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon  but expose him to a single yearold beauty and hes a mess  much to gavins surprise  the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan  lynn redgrave   a rich  married  and lonely yearold  getting it right is the simple story of gavins awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right  that is  to find the right woman to fulfill his life  getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to indepth character development  gavins selfconscious voiceover narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche  we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and selfconfident maturity  birdsalls superb  understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film  he seems convincing and authentic throughout  the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavins life  despite her limited screen time  redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavins middleaged seducer  for a supporting character  joan is unusually and impressively complex  thanks in large part to redgraves magnificent performance  gavin is also pursued  or perhaps plagued  by minnie  the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat  after minnie and gavin meet at a party  she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life  helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role  and sir john gielgud  with his tongue in his cheek  embodies the height of arrogance as her father  gavins eventual loveinterest is jenny  the adorable twentyyearold single mother who assists him at the beauty salon  london stage actress jane horrocks fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character  peter cook  the great british satirist  appears briefly in the film as gavins uptight employer  the scenes of gavins home life with his parents are also a treat  gavins overprotective mother  pat heywood   whom even woody allen would find overbearing  almost steals the movie  her life seems limited to just two activities  treating gavin like a yearold and preparing exotic but inedible meals  such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce  gavin and his fathers attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing  getting it right  for the most part  is very wellcrafted  except for two minor shortcomings  first  the movie is about  minutes too long  and consequently it loses momentum at times  second  the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavins best friend  harry  and his unfaithful lover  winthrop  overall  however  getting it right is quite memorable for its humor  depth  sophistication  and outstanding acting  director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard  adapting her own highly acclaimed novel  deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth  maturation  and selfdiscovery  \",\n          \"carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town  she goes to college in california  there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore  who is a city boy  when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving  she brings shore with her  and her parents  lane smith and cindy pickett  are less than thrilled  dan gauthier  guginos boyfriend from high school  proposes to gugino  gugino isnt ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore  she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end  forget jurassic park  cliffhanger  the firm and last action hero  soninlaw is the film to see this summer  soninlaw is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers  especially fans of the wiez  when soninlaw is long gone and forgotten  the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then  this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it  nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen  although the basic story line has been done many  many times before  the film is still fun to watch  the laughs are plentiful  especially when the wiez is around  the way some of the jokes are done are new  even though some of the jokes are old  there are also several new jokes that  at least  i havent seen before  still  when presented right  even old material can be funny still  this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesnt contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price  the cast for this film does an excellent job  pauly shore  encino man  is the star attraction of this film  he is great  and knows how to entertain the audience  pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious  this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role  carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl  she makes her character believable  on some levels  yet interesting at the same time  the person who played the grandfather  mason adams  i believe  also does a great job  the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen  patrick renna  who played guginos little brother  was a little annoying  but no where as near as macaulay culkin  and for only part of the time  so i can forgive him  tiffaniamber thiessen  a killer among friends   saved by the bell   does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen  she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television  she wasnt given overly much to do in the film  but

the mainstream of american consciousness   hmm  you never know  they just might be on to something  what with the rise of geek chic  lounge music and seventies fashion  the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own  but then  i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it  its cheesy all right  but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  thats a shame  because  in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise  roy munson  the movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers digestgumpian wisdom in scoopfuls  shifting to the s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray  as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  its thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good  he gives the wry  derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job  then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand  then its fast forward  years later when munson is a fat  balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  hes hopeless until he meets ishmael  randy quaid   an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno  picking up pretty hustler claudia  vanessa angel  on the way  with the exit of bill murray  the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go  and thats    dumb and dumber  yes  indeed  kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour  peter and bobby farrelly  the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle  so  prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands  distended nipples  ridiculous hair and bull semen  get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community  or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking  striptease and unchristian neighboursocking  now  dont get me wrong  theres nothing wrong with cheap humour  and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy  the trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction  it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama   pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal  and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack   never quite getting it all together  some gags fall flat from a lack of buildup  while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything  why the long  unfunny fight in the car park  why two of these  why does that guy wear mascara  or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it  the film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer  grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying   wouldnt that be funny    well  no  actually  the actors dont do the movie much favours either  woody harrelson comes off okay  plausibly acting dumb  smart  cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it  but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham  and vanessa angel has no talent  like schwarzenegger  she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human  take the tv series weird science    please    even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax  all in all  a fairly useless attempt at comedy  and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance  well have to look to a reinspired john waters  or perhaps somebody from down under   strictly bowling   anyone   for the definitive bowling comedy  the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  \",\n          \"the camera zooms in incredibly close  it focuses on the closed eyes of a person presumed dead  all of a sudden  with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  his eyelids open  the camera zooms in incredibly close  it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life  then  with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  she bumps into the killer  the camera zooms in incredibly close  it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate  all of a sudden  with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  the doors swing open to reveal whats inside  closeup thrillshots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear  which is a pretty good sign that youre not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned  rather  you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that theyre in  that you stop caring about who lives  who dies and where the story goes  instead  you become more interested in how the characters get killed off  the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray  two couples and dear friends to one another  during the summer just after high school graduation  they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway  suddenly  without warning  their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision  fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess  they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again  a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change  relationships fizzle  future dreams crumble  and attitudes change  but  they can not forget what they did  and apparently  neither can someone else  someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message   i know what you did last summer   the letterwriter  a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook  soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens  its now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before its too late  while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects  too much of its impact had to be generated with extreme closeups  while the level of suspense was choppy at best  there is so much more that this movie could have been  but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills  it could have been a clever whodunit  but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders  it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood  but seemed to only include that aspect to add  more minutes to the film  it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime youre alone and you see shadowy figures moving about  you dont walk towards them yelling  hello   once you yell  hello   you can expect an extreme closeup  a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  its difficult to be in suspense when you know whats about to happen  the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume  but im not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks  the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it  \",\n          \"an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england  the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects  more specifically  the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf  and for the ghosts that haunt the main character  even twenty years after its release  that part of the movie is still impressive  although  i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive  the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure  if it werent for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in   and with good reason  the acting isnt great and neither is the writing  well ok  we dont actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film  but one other important element is lacking here too  it isnt scary  with no exception  you know what is going to happen before it happens  you dont even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint  i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen  but john  it just wasnt scary  i didnt know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it  but it didnt work for me  actually  it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films  but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad  the intended humor was lost on me  its never a good sign that you dont realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material  call me crazy  but you shouldnt have to do research on a movie to enjoy it  im not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much  since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up  werewolf bites boy  david naughton   boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse  jenny agutter  and then strange things begin to happen to boy  including  and i must admit this is a very nice touch  visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital  the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse  i know it sounds strange  but it actually works  the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy  griffin dunne  are really the best parts of the movie  as i said  probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects  while they are still impressive today  they arent impressive enough  or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film  and since they are more or less the highlight of the film  there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch  actually  the  sequel  an american werewolf in paris  is more entertaining since it doesnt take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

building  always bring your crowbar  dont stand in the way of your wifes actualization as a man  and  whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being  wear old clothes  because  hey  its muddy in there    being john malkovich  is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  wildly surrealistic  yet presented in a downtoearth  funky style  this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline  you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself  theres a lot to think about here  just dont forget to have fun  clearly  all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did  starting with writer charles kaufman    i wrote being john malkovich without an outline   he explains in the press notes   blindly  with no sense of direction or purpose  its important to me that i dont have a map before i start  this allows me to surprise myself  stay engaged  discover things  and  hopefully  allow the unconscious to surface   spike jonze  mark wahlbergs na  ve buddy in  three kings   takes it from there  the whitehot director of the beastie boys  sabotage   an awardwinning parody of s tv cop shows  as well as numerous other music videos and commercials  eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut  jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a lowkey style  his flat  matteroffact approach works perfectly  and then theres the cast  john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz  a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive  but decidedly erotic puppet shows  over the years  his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte  cameron diaz  has devolved  once passionate lovers  the two are now little more than courteous roommates  financially strapped  craig takes a job as an entrylevel file clerk at lestercorp  located on the  th floor of a manhattan building  navigating around dr  lester  orson bean   his  yearold boss and floris  mary kay place   lesters dotty secretary  craig tries to settle into his new position  but two things keep him distracted  first  theres the beautiful and imperious maxine  catherine keener   who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her  and then theres the hole behind the file cabinet  which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich  craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich  where they can experience life from his point of view  with enough concentration  you can even influence his actions   after  minutes  the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike  then things get a little weird  by the way  if youre concerned that i gave away too much of the plot  rest assured   i barely scratched the surface  one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre setup  instead  he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich  rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another persons identity  he also examines the consequences of the malkovisits to craig  lotte  maxine and  of course  john malkovich himself  the performances are superb  malkovich  best known to mainstream audiences for his work in  dangerous liaisons    in the line of fire   and as head psychopath in the guiltypleasure  con air   tweaks his own image in a dandy selfdeprecating turn  far from his effete  vaguely reptilian persona  this malkovich is just another schlub  drinking with his pals and trying to get laid  incidentally  charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his wellearned bad boy reputation   as always  john cusack nails his part  handily pulling viewers along even as craigs actions become unconscionable  the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz  both playing against type  kenner  usually cast in icy subordinate roles  is terrific as a highly intelligent  extremely manipulative femme fatale  cameron diaz  barely recognizable under a mess of brown  curly hair  sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich    being john malkovich  stumbles towards the end  as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots  additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale  regardless  this contemporary  alice in wonderland  is a real treat  i enjoyed watching  being john malkovich   but only later  after reflecting on the film  did its resonance fully hit me  at one point  craig says   do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is   truer words were never spoken  \",\n          \"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  when those observers are joel and ethan coen  the surreal becomes bizarre  when the life is that of jeff  the dude  leboswki  the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of  whatsgoingonaroundhere   the marvelous sound of  the stranger   sam elliot  s voiceover introduces the film  at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  the dude  jeff bridges  is described as the  laziest man in los angeles  possibly the world   although hes not so much slothful as he is relaxed  spending the last  years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other  he doesnt have much of a life  but hes having a good time  when asked what he does for fun  he responds  bowl  drive around and the occasional acid flashback   lebowskis passion is bowling  when hes not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike  things just happen to him  arriving home one night  hes beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  even worse  they urinate on his rug  the problem is that the dude doesnt have a wife  his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  the  big  lebowski  david huddleston  is a multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor  the next day  our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together  not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there  when hes denied any money  he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  on his way out  he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny  tara reid  who offers to perform a sexual act that  according to rumor  is one of bill clintons favorites for a thousand bucks  the penniless dude wisecracks that hes heading for the cash machine  later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunnys kidnappers  this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences  the kidnappers are impossibly inept  the dude and his cronies are even worse  every plan goes awry  you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  thats the story  but to tell the truth it doesnt much matter  there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  the dudes bowling buddies walter  john goodman  and donny  steve buscemi  look like people youd see on the street but  like everything else in this film  theyre not quite what they seem  walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties  everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam  when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wont admit it  walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet  donny gets precious few words in between walters screaming and the dudes rambling  when he does  walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns  donny is  out of his league  and doesnt  have a frame of reference   the film is peppered with people for whom the term  character  would be an understatement  the big lebowskis daughter maude  an avantgarde  vaginal  artist  paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an sm mary martin  the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers  bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star  most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler  as the flamenco music swells  we see him putting on his lavender hose  the camera pans up to an allpurple skintight bowling outfit with  jesus   pronounced with a  j   not an  h   embroidered on the pocket  he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail  his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball  bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has  i cant think of anyone else who could have done a better job  buscemi has a limited role  but he plays it perfectly  the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that hes one of the treasures of our time  its odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband  more like the coens  raising arizona  than their hit  fargo    the big lebowski  demands an open mind and even more open eyes  a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen  much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss  theres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it  walking out of the theater  i felt that the film had something important to say  on further examination  i wasnt sure exactly what it was    if you meet jesus at the bowling alley  its not going to be what you expect     when the going gets weird  the weird go bowling   maybe theres no real message  perhaps its just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world  maybe thats enough    michael redman has written this column for  years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about  the man in the iron mask  starring that favorite of yearold girls of all ages  redmanbvoice  com is the eaddress for estuff   \",\n          \"in october of   audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer  the film went on to gross over  million dollars in the u  s   and even developed a cult following  much like the previous years  million dollar grossing scream  when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend  it looked like a wonderful followup  did it live up to the first film  the answer is no  jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james  a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before  she has been so upset since the incident  nightmares haunt her all over the place  but she has to move on  she know attends college  and is best friends with a funny  outgoing girl named karla  brandy   who is trying to hook julie up with will benson  played by newcomer matthew settle  karlas boyfriend is tyrell  the funny  outgoing type  who is played by soul foods mekhi phifer  freddie prinze jr  also returns as ray  julies boyfriend from a year ago  one morning  julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil  of course  they answer it correctly  and they are off to the bahamas  julie wants ray to come  but he declines the offer  so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie  after they arrive at their hotel  it is just them and the staff on the island  it starts off as the weekend of their dreams  something just had to come to mess up the one carefree weekend of julies life though  ben willis  muse watson  is back  and he isnt letting anyone survive this time  will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one  jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances  brandy in particular was impressive  considering this is her first feature film  you could see that the characters were horrified  and they would do anything possible to survive  matthew settle and freddie prinze jr  are a completely different story  lets start with settle  matthew is completely fake in this film  you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth  you could tell he was acting  and its reasons like him that this one isnt as good as the first one  he does do a good job towards the end  but that doesnt clear up the scars he already left on the film  freddie prinze jr  is almost as bad as matthew settle was  he is almost completely unbelievable  and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place  we dont see him as much as settle  otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did  mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell  but yet again the dialogue is out of place  the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie  i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment  but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one  it would have been a bit better  the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful  there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel  the sound is pretty good  but still not as creepy as the first films  jennifer love hewitts song   how do i deal  is also played for about thirty seconds  i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film  the first film was very suspenseful  and it contained some very memorable scenes  the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up  and almost reached the same level as the first film  before this part in the film  there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares  that is okay though  because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes  i think the reason this film wasnt as scary as the original was because in the first one  the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident  he made them suffer for what they did  in the second film  ben willis just kills anyone he feels like  he doesnt stick with ray and julie  who were the ones he is actually after  he had to go after karla  will  and tyrell  if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie  ray  helen  and barry  it could have been much better  and it would have made a lot more sense  the bottom line not a disappointment  but a third in the series would be out of hand  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n

the mainstream of american consciousness   hmm  you never know  they just might be on to something  what with the rise of geek chic  lounge music and seventies fashion  the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own  but then  i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it  its cheesy all right  but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  thats a shame  because  in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise  roy munson  the movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers digestgumpian wisdom in scoopfuls  shifting to the s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray  as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  its thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good  he gives the wry  derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job  then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand  then its fast forward  years later when munson is a fat  balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  hes hopeless until he meets ishmael  randy quaid   an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno  picking up pretty hustler claudia  vanessa angel  on the way  with the exit of bill murray  the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go  and thats    dumb and dumber  yes  indeed  kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour  peter and bobby farrelly  the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle  so  prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands  distended nipples  ridiculous hair and bull semen  get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community  or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking  striptease and unchristian neighboursocking  now  dont get me wrong  theres nothing wrong with cheap humour  and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy  the trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction  it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama   pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal  and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack   never quite getting it all together  some gags fall flat from a lack of buildup  while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything  why the long  unfunny fight in the car park  why two of these  why does that guy wear mascara  or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it  the film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer  grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying   wouldnt that be funny    well  no  actually  the actors dont do the movie much favours either  woody harrelson comes off okay  plausibly acting dumb  smart  cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it  but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham  and vanessa angel has no talent  like schwarzenegger  she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human  take the tv series weird science    please    even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax  all in all  a fairly useless attempt at comedy  and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance  well have to look to a reinspired john waters  or perhaps somebody from down under   strictly bowling   anyone   for the definitive bowling comedy  the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  \",\n          \"the camera zooms in incredibly close  it focuses on the

on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate  all of a sudden  with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  the doors swing open to reveal whats inside  closeup thrillshots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear  which is a pretty good sign that youre not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned  rather  you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that theyre in  that you stop caring about who lives  who dies and where the story goes  instead  you become more interested in how the characters get killed off  the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray  two couples and dear friends to one another  during the summer just after high school graduation  they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway  suddenly  without warning  their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision  fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess  they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again  a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change  relationships fizzle  future dreams crumble  and attitudes change  but  they can not forget what they did  and apparently  neither can someone else  someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message   i know what you did last summer   the letterwriter  a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook  soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens  its now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before its too late  while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects  too much of its impact had to be generated with extreme closeups  while the level of suspense was choppy at best  there is so much more that this movie could have been  but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills  it could have been a clever whodunit  but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders  it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood  but seemed to only include that aspect to add  more minutes to the film  it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime youre alone and you see shadowy figures moving about  you dont walk towards them yelling  hello   once you yell  hello   you can expect an extreme closeup  a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  its difficult to be in suspense when you know whats about to happen  the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume  but im not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks  the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it  \",\n          \"an american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england  the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects  more specifically  the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf  and for the ghosts that haunt the main character  even twenty years after its release  that part of the movie is still impressive  although  i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive  the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure  if it werent for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in   and with good reason  the acting isnt great and neither is the writing  well ok  we dont actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film  but one other important element is lacking here too  it isnt scary  with no exception  you know what is going to happen before it happens  you dont even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint  i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen  but john  it just wasnt scary  i didnt know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it  but it didnt work for me  actually  it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films  but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad  the intended humor was lost on me  its never a good sign that you dont realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material  call me crazy  but you shouldnt have to do research on a movie to enjoy it  im not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much  since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up  werewolf bites boy  david naughton   boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse  jenny agutter  and then strange things begin to happen to boy  including  and i must admit this is a very nice touch  visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital  the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse  i know it sounds strange  but it actually works  the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy  griffin dunne  are really the best parts of the movie  as i said  probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects  while they are still impressive today  they arent impressive enough  or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film  and since they are more or less the highlight of the film  there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch  actually  the  sequel  an american werewolf in paris  is more entertaining since it doesnt take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

building  always bring your crowbar  dont stand in the way of your wifes actualization as a man  and  whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being  wear old clothes  because  hey  its muddy in there    being john malkovich  is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  wildly surrealistic  yet presented in a downtoearth  funky style  this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline  you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself  theres a lot to think about here  just dont forget to have fun  clearly  all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did  starting with writer charles kaufman    i wrote being john malkovich without an outline   he explains in the press notes   blindly  with no sense of direction or purpose  its important to me that i dont have a map before i start  this allows me to surprise myself  stay engaged  discover things  and  hopefully  allow the unconscious to surface   spike jonze  mark wahlbergs na  ve buddy in  three kings   takes it from there  the whitehot director of the beastie boys  sabotage   an awardwinning parody of s tv cop shows  as well as numerous other music videos and commercials  eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut  jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a lowkey style  his flat  matteroffact approach works perfectly  and then theres the cast  john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz  a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive  but decidedly erotic puppet shows  over the years  his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte  cameron diaz  has devolved  once passionate lovers  the two are now little more than courteous roommates  financially strapped  craig takes a job as an entrylevel file clerk at lestercorp  located on the  th floor of a manhattan building  navigating around dr  lester  orson bean   his  yearold boss and floris  mary kay place   lesters dotty secretary  craig tries to settle into his new position  but two things keep him distracted  first  theres the beautiful and imperious maxine  catherine keener   who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her  and then theres the hole behind the file cabinet  which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich  craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich  where they can experience life from his point of view  with enough concentration  you can even influence his actions   after  minutes  the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike  then things get a little weird  by the way  if youre concerned that i gave away too much of the plot  rest assured   i barely scratched the surface  one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre setup  instead  he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich  rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another persons identity  he also examines the consequences of the malkovisits to craig  lotte  maxine and  of course  john malkovich himself  the performances are superb  malkovich  best known to mainstream audiences for his work in  dangerous liaisons    in the line of fire   and as head psychopath in the guiltypleasure  con air   tweaks his own image in a dandy selfdeprecating turn  far from his effete  vaguely reptilian persona  this malkovich is just another schlub  drinking with his pals and trying to get laid  incidentally  charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his wellearned bad boy reputation   as always  john cusack nails his part  handily pulling viewers along even as craigs actions become unconscionable  the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz  both playing against type  kenner  usually cast in icy subordinate roles  is terrific as a highly intelligent  extremely manipulative femme fatale  cameron diaz  barely recognizable under a mess of brown  curly hair  sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich    being john malkovich  stumbles towards the end  as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots  additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale  regardless  this contemporary  alice in wonderland  is a real treat  i enjoyed watching  being john malkovich   but only later  after reflecting on the film  did its resonance fully hit me  at one point  craig says   do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is   truer words were never spoken  \",\n          \"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright  by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  when those observers are joel and ethan coen  the surreal becomes bizarre  when the life is that of jeff  the dude  leboswki  the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of  whatsgoingonaroundhere   the marvelous sound of  the stranger   sam elliot  s voiceover introduces the film  at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  the dude  jeff bridges  is described as the  laziest man in los angeles  possibly the world   although hes not so much slothful as he is relaxed  spending the last  years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other  he doesnt have much of a life  but hes having a good time  when asked what he does for fun  he responds  bowl  drive around and the occasional acid flashback   lebowskis passion is bowling  when hes not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike  things just happen to him  arriving home one night  hes beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  even worse  they urinate on his rug  the problem is that the dude doesnt have a wife  his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  the  big  lebowski  david huddleston  is a multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor  the next day  our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together  not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there  when hes denied any money  he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  on his way out  he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny  tara reid  who offers to perform a sexual act that  according to rumor  is one of bill clintons favorites for a thousand bucks  the penniless dude wisecracks that hes heading for the cash machine  later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunnys kidnappers  this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences  the kidnappers are impossibly inept  the dude and his cronies are even worse  every plan goes awry  you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  thats the story  but to tell the truth it doesnt much matter  there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  the dudes bowling buddies walter  john goodman  and donny  steve buscemi  look like people youd see on the street but  like everything else in this film  theyre not quite what they seem  walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties  everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam  when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wont admit it  walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet  donny gets precious few words in between walters screaming and the dudes rambling  when he does  walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns  donny is  out of his league  and doesnt  have a frame of reference   the film is peppered with people for whom the term  character  would be an understatement  the big lebowskis daughter maude  an avantgarde  vaginal  artist  paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an sm mary martin  the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers  bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star  most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler  as the flamenco music swells  we see him putting on his lavender hose  the camera pans up to an allpurple skintight bowling outfit with  jesus   pronounced with a  j   not an  h   embroidered on the pocket  he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail  his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball  bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has  i cant think of anyone else who could have done a better job  buscemi has a limited role  but he plays it perfectly  the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that hes one of the treasures of our time  its odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband  more like the coens  raising arizona  than their hit  fargo    the big lebowski  demands an open mind and even more open eyes  a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen  much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss  theres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it  walking out of the theater  i felt that the film had something important to say  on further examination  i wasnt sure exactly what it was    if you meet jesus at the bowling alley  its not going to be what you expect     when the going gets weird  the weird go bowling   maybe theres no real message  perhaps its just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world  maybe thats enough    michael redman has written this column for  years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about  the man in the iron mask  starring that favorite of yearold girls of all ages  redmanbvoice  com is the eaddress for estuff   \",\n          \"in october of   audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer  the film went on to gross over  million dollars in the u  s   and even developed a cult following  much like the previous years  million dollar grossing scream  when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend  it looked like a wonderful followup  did it live up to the first film  the answer is no  jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james  a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before  she has been so upset since the incident  nightmares haunt her all over the place  but she has to move on  she know attends college  and is best friends with a funny  outgoing girl named karla  brandy   who is trying to hook julie up with will benson  played by newcomer matthew settle  karlas boyfriend is tyrell  the funny  outgoing type  who is played by soul foods mekhi phifer  freddie prinze jr  also returns as ray  julies boyfriend from a year ago  one morning  julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil  of course  they answer it correctly  and they are off to the bahamas  julie wants ray to come  but he declines the offer  so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie  after they arrive at their hotel  it is just them and the staff on the island  it starts off as the weekend of their dreams  something just had to come to mess up the one carefree weekend of julies life though  ben willis  muse watson  is back  and he isnt letting anyone survive this time  will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one  jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances  brandy in particular was impressive  considering this is her first feature film  you could see that the characters were horrified  and they would do anything possible to survive  matthew settle and freddie prinze jr  are a completely different story  lets start with settle  matthew is completely fake in this film  you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth  you could tell he was acting  and its reasons like him that this one isnt as good as the first one  he does do a good job towards the end  but that doesnt clear up the scars he already left on the film  freddie prinze jr  is almost as bad as matthew settle was  he is almost completely unbelievable  and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place  we dont see him as much as settle  otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did  mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell  but yet again the dialogue is out of place  the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie  i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment  but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one  it would have been a bit better  the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful  there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel  the sound is pretty good  but still not as creepy as the first films  jennifer love hewitts song   how do i deal  is also played for about thirty seconds  i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film  the first film was very suspenseful  and it contained some very memorable scenes  the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up  and almost reached the same level as the first film  before this part in the film  there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares  that is okay though  because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes  i think the reason this film wasnt as scary as the original was because in the first one  the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident  he made them suffer for what they did  in the second film  ben willis just kills anyone he feels like  he doesnt stick with ray and julie  who were the ones he is actually after  he had to go after karla  will  and tyrell  if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie  ray  helen  and barry  it could have been much better  and it would have made a lot more sense  the bottom line not a disappointment  but a third in the series would be out of hand  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n
